Fix issue where K8S cluster does not pull down the latest image even though it has been updated in the registry:
    kuberenetes\refreshK8S.sh - kubectl set image deployment/aspnet-core-linux-deployment aspnet-core-linux=VALUEOF-REGISTRY-SERVER-NAME/gbbossdemo/aspnet-core-linux:latest
    we need this line to vary between aspnet-core-linux:latest and aspnet-core-linux (Tag change enforces a new image pull)
